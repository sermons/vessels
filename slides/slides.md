+ **Arminianism** (Jacobus Arminius, ~1590s)
  + (Methodist, some Mennonite, e.g., [Keith Drury](http://www.crivoice.org/arminianism.html))
  + *Resistable* **Grace** ("synergistic")

## The Bible is clear on:

## Theodicy (Is God Just?)
+ Q <span class="ref">(Mackie)</span>:
  If God is *omniscient*, *omnipotent*, and *omni-benevolent*,
  why is there evil?
+ **Augustine**: evil is from *man's* disobedience
  + e.g., *Plantinga*'s free will defense:
  + Omnipotent, but not necc. make *contradictions*
  + Full human *autonomy* &rArr;&lArr; God's *sovereignty*
+ **Irenaeus** / Origien: world as *school*
  + Suffering necessary for human *growth*
  + e.g., *Swinburne*: free will &rArr; learn from mistakes
  + but see, e.g., Dostoyevsky, <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>

>>>
+ Problem of Evil (Mackie, 1955)
+ **omnipotent**: doesn't mean He creates logical **contradictions**
  + stone too **heavy** for God to lift
+ **Irenaeus**: "there's always a **purpose**"
  + e.g., lost **keys** &rArr; found $100
  + what about **cancer**? Holocaust? Malicious cruelty?
+ evil not a **tool** for good
  + Christ **died**: pay penalty
  + **conquered** sin + death
+ is it **unfair** that God saves one and not another?

Certainly not! For He says to Moses,

“I will have **mercy** on whomever I will have mercy,
and I will have **compassion**
on whomever I will have compassion.”

So then it is not of him who **wills**,
nor of him who **runs**,
but of God who shows **mercy**.
