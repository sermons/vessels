+ free will, choice:
  + repent, for kingdom is near
  + choose this day, me + my family
+ suffering / theodicy: is evil God's fault? 
+ what if God predestined me to be bad? 
+ futile to preach the gospel? 
+ theodicy (Mackie): omniscient, omnipotent, omni-benevolent
+ Irenaeus / Origien: world as school
  + suffering necessary for human growth
  + process theology: God himself growing
    + becoming vs being
+ Augustine: evil from man's disobedience
+ e.g., Plantinga free will: 
  + omnipotent !=> obligated to create contradictions

# Is God **unfair**?

You will say to me then, <br/>
“Why does he still find **fault**?  <br/>
For who can **resist** his will?” 

But who are **you**, O man,  <br/>
to answer back to **God**?

Will what is **molded** say to its molder,  <br/>
“**Why** have you made me like this?”

Has the **potter** no right over the clay,  <br/>
to make out of the same lump  <br/>
one **vessel** for **honorable** use  <br/>
and another for dishonorable use?

<div class="ref">
Romans 9:20-21 (ESV) (p.2/4)

What if God, desiring to show his **wrath**  <br/>
and to make known his **power**,

has endured with much **patience**  <br/>
**vessels of wrath** prepared for destruction, 

<div class="ref">
Romans 9:22 (ESV) (p.3/4)
</div>

---
in order to make known  <br/>
the riches of his glory for **vessels of mercy**,  <br/>
which he has **prepared** beforehand for glory — 

even us whom he has **called**,  <br/>
not from the Jews only  <br/>
but also from the Gentiles?
