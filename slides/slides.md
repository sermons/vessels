# Q0

---
You will say to me then, <br/>
“Why does he still find **fault**? For who can **resist** his will?” 

But who are **you**, O man, to answer back to **God**?  <br/>
Will what is **molded** say to its molder,  <br/>
“**Why** have you made me like this?”

Has the **potter** no right over the clay,  <br/>
to make out of the same lump one **vessel** <br/>
for **honorable** use and another for dishonorable use?

---
What if God, desiring to show his **wrath**  <br/>
and to make known his **power**,  <br/>
has endured with much **patience**  <br/>
**vessels of wrath** prepared for destruction, 

in order to make known  <br/>
the riches of his glory for **vessels of mercy**,  <br/>
which he has **prepared** beforehand for glory — 

even us whom he has **called**,  <br/>
not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?
