### Q: God **desires** all to be saved, <br/> but **not** all will be. **Why**?
+ **Calvinism** (John Calvin, ~1550s)
  + (Reformed, most Baptist, e.g., [John Piper](http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/what-we-believe-about-the-five-points-of-calvinism))
  + *Limited* **Atonement**: only for the elect
  + *Irresistable* **Grace**: sovereignty of God
+ **Arminianism** (Jacobus Arminius, ~1590s)
  + (Methodist, some Mennonite, e.g., [Keith Drury](http://www.crivoice.org/arminianism.html))
  + *Resistable* **Grace** ("synergistic")
  + *Unlimited* **Atonement**: effective to all who believe

>>>
+ debate ultimately mostly **semantic**

---
## The Bible is clear on:
+ God's sovereign **authority**:
  + God's purpose of *election* (Rom 9:12)
+ God's **character** desires to show grace:
  + No *pleasure* in the death of anyone (Ez18:32)
+ Man's **response**: repent + follow
  + *Turn* and live (Ez18:32, Rom 10:9-10)

## Theodicy (Is God Just?)
+ Q <span class="ref">(Mackie)</span>:
  If God is *omniscient*, *omnipotent*, and *omni-benevolent*,
  why is there evil?
+ **Augustine**: evil is from *man's* disobedience
  + e.g., *Plantinga*'s free will defense:
  + Omnipotent, but not necc. make *contradictions*
  + Full human *autonomy* &rArr;&lArr; God's *sovereignty*
+ **Irenaeus** / Origien: world as *school*
  + Suffering necessary for human *growth*
  + e.g., *Swinburne*: free will &rArr; learn from mistakes
  + but see, e.g., Dostoyevsky, <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>

>>>
+ Problem of Evil (Mackie, 1955)
+ **omnipotent** &#8655; make logical **contradictions**
  + stone too **heavy** for God to lift
+ **Irenaeus**: "there's always a **purpose**"
  + e.g., lost **keys** &rArr; found $100
  + what about **cancer**? Holocaust? Malicious cruelty?
+ evil not a **tool** for good
  + Christ **died** to do away w/sin's penalty
  + **conquered** sin + death
+ is it **unfair** that God saves one and not another?

---
Certainly not! For He says to Moses,

“I will have **mercy** on whomever I will have mercy,
and I will have **compassion**
on whomever I will have compassion.”

So then it is not of him who **wills**,
nor of him who **runs**,
but of God who shows **mercy**.

+ we assume **most** people are good

+ so God's **justice** would be hell
  + that we **live** + breathe is His mercy
+ God says the same even to wicked **Pharaoh**:

---
For by now I could have stretched out my hand <br/>
and [...] **wiped** you off the earth.

But I have raised you up for this very **purpose**, <br/>
that I might show you my **power** and that <br/>
