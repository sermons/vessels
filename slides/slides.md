You will say to me then, <br/>
“Why does he still find **fault**?  <br/>
For who can **resist** his will?”

But who are **you**, O man,  <br/>
to answer back to **God**?

[Romans 9:19-20 (ESV) (p.1/4)](# "ref")

******
Will what is **molded** say to its molder,  <br/>
“**Why** have you made me like this?”

Has the **potter** no right over the clay,  <br/>
to make out of the same lump  <br/>
one **vessel** for **honorable** use  <br/>
and another for dishonorable use?

[Romans 9:20-21 (ESV) (p.2/4)](# "ref")

What if God, desiring to show his **wrath**  <br/>

has endured with much **patience**  <br/>
**vessels of wrath** prepared for destruction,

the riches of his glory for **vessels of mercy**,  <br/>

### Q: God **desires** all to be saved, <br/> but **not** all will be. **Why**?
+ **Calvinism** (John Calvin, ~1550s)
  + (Reformed, most Baptist: e.g., [John Piper](http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/what-we-believe-about-the-five-points-of-calvinism))
  + *Limited* **Atonement**: only for the elect
  + *Irresistable* **Grace**: sovereignty of God
+ **Arminianism** (Jacobus Arminius, ~1590s)
  + (Methodist, some Menno: e.g., [Keith Drury](http://www.crivoice.org/arminianism.html))
  + *Resistable* **Grace** ("synergistic")
  + *Unlim* **Atonement**: eff. to all who believe

>>>
+ debate ultimately mostly **semantic**

---
## The Bible is clear on:
+ God is sovereign in His **authority**:
  + "God's purpose of *election* ..." [(Rom 9:12)](# "ref")
+ God's **character** desires to show grace:
  + "No *pleasure* in death of any ..." [(Ez18:32)](# "ref")
+ Man must **respond**: repent + follow
  + "*Turn* and live!" [(Ez18:32, Rom 10:9-10)](# "ref")

## Theodicy (Is God Just?)
+ Q [(Mackie)](# "ref"):
  If God is *omniscient*, *omnipotent*, and *omni-benevolent*,
  why is there **evil**?
+ **Man's disobedience** [(e.g., Augustine)](# "ref")
  + [(Plantinga)](# "ref"): free will defense
  + Omnipotent, need not make *contradictions*
  + Full *autonomy* &rArr;&lArr; God's *sovereignty*
+ **World is a school** [(e.g., Irenaeus, Origien)](# "ref")
  + Suffering necessary for human *growth*
  + [(Swinburne)](# "ref"): free will &rArr; *learn* from mistakes
    <br><small> but see, e.g.,
      <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> [(Dostoyevsky)](# "ref")
    </small>

>>>
+ Problem of Evil (Mackie, 1955)
+ **omnipotent**: doesn't mean He creates logical **contradictions**
  + stone too **heavy** for God to lift
+ **Irenaeus**: "there's always a **purpose**"
  + e.g., lost **keys** &rArr; found $100
  + what about **cancer**? Holocaust? Malicious cruelty?
+ Ivan Karamazov: free will a **curse**, so hates God
  + Alyosha: **Christ** took curse for us
+ evil not a **tool** for good
  + Christ **died**: pay penalty
  + **conquered** sin + death
+ is it **unfair** that God saves one and not another?

<!-- .slide: <%= bg("unsplash-Jztmx9yqjBw-stars.jpg") %> -->
Certainly not! For He says to Moses,

“I will have **mercy** on whomever I will have mercy,
and I will have **compassion**
on whomever I will have compassion.”

So then it is not of him who **wills**,
nor of him who **runs**,
but of God who shows **mercy**.

[Romans 9:15-16 (NKJV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ we assume **most** people are good
  + and **deserve** to be saved
+ or maybe even **50/50**
+ but because of God's perfect **holiness**
  + and our utter **depravity**,
  + lust for **autonomy** from Him
+ &rArr; God's **justice** would be hell
  + that we **live** + breathe is His mercy
+ What He said to wicked **Pharaoh**:

---
<!-- .slide: <%= bg("Egypt_Giza_Sphinx.jpg") %> -->
For by now I could have stretched out my hand <br/>
and [...] **wiped** you off the earth.

But I have raised you up for this very **purpose**, <br/>

You still **set yourself** against my people <br/>
